                        <p>We can read JavaScript line by line. It can also result in a successive code line being
                            performed before an earlier code line. A callback function prevents this situation since it
                            is not called until the preceding code line has completely performed.</p>

                        <p> Float is used when you required to keep your web page element pushed to the left or right

                        <p>In JavaScript, inheritance is different from a lot of other development languages. In
                            JavaScript the object system based on a prototype, not the class. Objects are only a
                            collection of value pairs and name.</p>
